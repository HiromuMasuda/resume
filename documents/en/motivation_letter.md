# Motivation Letter

I would like to analyze/develop using bigdata.

- Data analyst: Analyze the data and apply it to the PDCA for the development of services.
- Machine learning engineer: I want to accelerate business using machine learning.

# Background of your choice

Having the goal "I want to become an engineer who can grow the service", I have been doing development from planning to development, full stack.
What I felt most strongly is that "how fast and how much quality of PDCA we can make?" And in order to realize it, I felt it was necessary to "judge quantitatively from data". As data becomes more important from now on, I want to become a specialist for the part about how to collect data, how to analyze it, and how to apply it.

# What you can do
### Basic knowledge around the Web · Development capability
Since I've been developing Web services full-stack from planning to development, I am confident in the basic knowledge and operation and development capabilities as a web programmer.

### Communication skills · business sense
I gained a sense while planning functions and making responsible persons for development etc. in my previous job.

## Anxious part · What you can not do
- Although we have learned all the knowledge necessary for data analysis and machine learning, we are anxious that there is no practical experience.
- I put an output experience on solving the problem of kaggle.
- I am hoping to put out the output stupidly even without experience.
